The Initial three tables created were a students, courses and professors table. The keys chosen for these were ID's, the student and professor ID would be numeric integers assigned as they join the school. The key for a course would be a mix of characters and integers for example 'MAT-345'. Additionally, items stored in the professor and student tables would be the first and last names along with contact info such as emails and phone numbers the user may have as well as the classes they take for students and classes they teach for professors. For the course table, the items would be the class times (for multiple of same course at different times), the semester as well as year that the course was taken to store historical data of the courses, as well as a list of the students in the class (creating a many to many relationship table) and a professor for each course (creating a one professor to many classes link). Overall, this shows the interconnectivity of the tables in an SQL data base. A great example of this is how a student is related to a class and a professor is related to a class, inadvertently allowing for a student to see their professor while keeping data clean precise and manageable.
